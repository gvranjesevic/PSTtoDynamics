# Phase 6: Advanced Data Synchronization and Conflict Resolution
## Overview
Phase 6 focuses on implementing robust data synchronization between PST files and Dynamics 365, with advanced conflict resolution capabilities. This phase ensures data integrity and consistency across the system.

## Core Objectives
1. **Bidirectional Synchronization**
   - Real-time sync between PST and Dynamics 365
   - Change tracking and delta updates
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Sync status monitoring and reporting

2. **Conflict Resolution System**
   - Automatic conflict detection
   - Resolution strategies (last-write-wins, manual resolution)
   - Conflict history tracking
   - Resolution workflow management

3. **Data Integrity Assurance**
   - Data validation and verification
   - Checksum generation and verification
   - Data consistency checks
   - Recovery mechanisms

4. **Sync Monitoring and Reporting**
   - Real-time sync status dashboard
   - Sync history and logs
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking and reporting

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Sync Engine Core
```python
class SyncEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sync_state = {}
        self.conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver()
        self.validator = DataValidator()
        self.monitor = SyncMonitor()

    def sync_data(self, source, target):
        # Implement sync logic
        pass

    def detect_conflicts(self):
        # Implement conflict detection
        pass

    def resolve_conflicts(self):
        # Implement conflict resolution
        pass
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution System
```python
class ConflictResolver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resolution_strategies = {
            'last_write_wins': self.last_write_wins,
            'manual': self.manual_resolution,
            'merge': self.merge_changes
        }

    def resolve(self, conflict):
        # Implement resolution logic
        pass
```

### 3. Data Validation System
```python
class DataValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.checksums = {}
        self.validation_rules = {}

    def validate_data(self, data):
        # Implement validation logic
        pass
```

### 4. Sync Monitoring System
```python
class SyncMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
        self.logs = []

    def track_sync(self, sync_event):
        # Implement monitoring logic
        pass
```
