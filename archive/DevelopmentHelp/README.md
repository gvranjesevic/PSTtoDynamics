# Development Help - Testing & Verification

This folder contains temporary testing scripts and verification tools used during development.

## Purpose:
- Quick tests to verify new functionality works correctly
- Temporary scripts to validate changes before integrating into main code
- Helper utilities for development and debugging
- Safe testing environment for experimental features

## Usage:
- Files here are temporary and may be deleted after verification
- Use these scripts to test individual components before integration
- Safe place to experiment without affecting main production code

**Note**: These are development aids, not part of the final production solution.
